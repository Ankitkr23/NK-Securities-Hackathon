     #NK Securities Volatility Curve Prediction - Kaggle Competition Solution
This repository presents the solution for the NK Securities Volatility Curve Prediction Kaggle Competition. The primary objective was to accurately forecast implied volatility curves, a critical component in financial modeling and options trading.

Competition Overview
Implied volatility curves are essential for understanding market expectations of future price movements and are fundamental to option pricing, risk management, and developing sophisticated trading strategies. The competition challenged participants to predict these curves based on provided financial time-series data, which included various features and iv_values representing different points on the volatility curve. A key aspect of the dataset was the presence of missing values, necessitating robust imputation techniques.

Solution Approach: Robust Iterative Imputation for Volatility Curves
My solution focuses on effectively handling missing data within the volatility curves using a sophisticated Iterative Imputation strategy. This method, often referred to as Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), leverages the relationships between existing features to intelligently estimate and fill in missing iv_values.

The core of this approach is:

IterativeImputer: This algorithm models each feature with missing values as a function of other features in a round-robin fashion, iteratively refining the imputed values.

ExtraTreesRegressor: Chosen as the estimator within the IterativeImputer due to its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data and its robustness against overfitting, making it well-suited for financial datasets.

Standard Scaling: All features are scaled prior to imputation to ensure optimal performance and convergence of the IterativeImputer.

This robust imputation strategy ensures that the output volatility curves are complete and statistically sound, providing a reliable basis for submission.
